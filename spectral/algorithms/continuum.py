Continuum and continuum removal.

Continuum is defined as convex hull of spectrum.
Continuum is removed from spectra by dividing spectra by its continuum.
That results in values between 0 and 1, where absorption bands are expressed as
drops below 1. It is useful for comparing and classification based on
absorption bands and indifferent to scale.

        First element contains reflectance values of points that belong to
